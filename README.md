# Lulu's Butcher Corpses
 
Meaningful butchery of rotten and dessicated corpses.

## Technical Details

Corpses which are not fresh do not yield their full butchery product. Items which deteriorate at a speed of more than 0.5/day will be destroyed. Items that rot will spawn rotted if possible or else be destroyed. This usually means that meat and leather will be destroyed, but other butcher products such as thrumbo horns or elephant tusks will be preserved. Lastly, if the corpse is rotting but not dessicated the butcher will get a strong negative thought.

You probably want mods that add additional butchery products (like [LuluBones](https://github.com/LoonyLadle/LuluBones)!) for this to be useful.
